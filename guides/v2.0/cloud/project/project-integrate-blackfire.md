## Get your Blackfire credentials {#cloud-int-black}
The account owner has access to the Blackfire credentials for your project. Contact the account owner for more information.

## Enable the Blackfire integration {#cloud-int-black-en}
We recommend you enable the Blackfire integration in an environment (that is, branch). You can optionally merge the environment with its parent after you know it's working.

To enable Blackfire:

1.	Log in to the machine on which your SSH keys are stored.
1.	Log in to your Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition project.

		magento-cloud login
2.	List projects:

		magento-cloud project:list
3.	List environments in the project:

		magento-cloud environment:list -p <project ID>
4.	See what branch you're currently in, if any.

		git branch
5.	If necessary, check out an existing branch:

		magento-cloud environment:checkout <environment ID>

	You can also create a new branch using the `magento-cloud environment:branch` command.
6.	Back up the environment using a snapshot:

		magento-cloud snapshot:create -e <environment ID>
6.	Use a text editor to open `<project root dir>/.magento.app.yaml`.
7.	Add the following to the `extensions` block under `runtime:`

		    - name: blackfire
		      configuration:
		         server_id: "<blackfire Server ID>"
		         server_token: "<blackfire Server token>"

	Change `<blackfire Server ID>` and `<blackfire Server token>` to the values from your Blackfire account.

	For example:

		runtime:
    	  extensions:
    	    - mcrypt
		    - redis
		    - xsl
		    - json
		    - name: blackfire
		      configuration:
		         server_id: "<blackfire Server ID>"
		         server_token: "<blackfire Server token>"
8.	Save your changes to `.magento.app.yaml` and exit the text editor.
9.	Add, commit, and push your changes to the environment:

		git add -A
		git commit -m "<message>"
		git push origin

	If errors display during deployment, open `.magento.app.yaml` and check the syntax. Check indentation and spelling and try again.

## Verify it's working {#cloud-int-black-verify}
To verify Blackfire works, you can SSH to the environment and run a command as follows:

1.	Log in to the Web UI.
2.	In the right pane, click the name of your environment.
3. 	Hover the mouse pointer over **Access site**.
4.	Copy the **SSH access** {% glossarytooltip a05c59d3-77b9-47d0-92a1-2cbffe3f8622 %}URL{% endglossarytooltip %} to the clipboard as the following figure shows.

	![Find the SSH URL for the environment]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_ssh-access2.png){:width="500px"}
5.	Enter that command in your terminal window to log in using SSH.
6.	Enter the following command:

		php --ri blackfire

	A sample result follows:

		blackfire

		Blackfire => enabled
		Blackfire => 1.10.3
		Timing measurement => cgt
		Num of CPU => 8
		Profiling heap memory => 0 Kb
		Main instance trigger mode => HTTP header triggered
		Main instance => enabled

        Main instance info
		Output stream => file
		Signature validated => no
		EnvId validated => no
		Fully decoded => no

		Directive => Local Value => Master Value
		blackfire.agent_socket => tcp://blackfire.platform.sh:8307 => tcp://blackfire.platform.sh:8307
		blackfire.agent_timeout => 10 => 10
		blackfire.env_id => no value => no value
		blackfire.env_token => no value => no value
		blackfire.log_level => 1 => 1
		blackfire.log_file => no value => no value

## Profile your site {#cloud-int-black-profile}
To start profiling your site using Blackfire:

1.	Install the Blackfire.io Companion browser {% glossarytooltip 9fceecbe-31be-4e49-aac7-11d155a85382 %}plug-in{% endglossarytooltip %} for your browser.

	For example, to install the Chrome Companion, see [Blackfire.io documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/chrome){:target="_blank"}.
2.	Use the Web UI to find the **Web access** URL for your environment as the following figure shows:

	![Find your environment's URL]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_web-access.png){:width="500px"}
2.	Go to your site using Chrome.
3.	In the upper right corner of the Chrome window, click ![Start Blackfire]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_blackfire-logo.png).
4.	Follow the prompts on your screen to set up a comparison, then click **Profile!** as the following figure shows.
