Everything in Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition is Git-driven. Not only the code, but also the
infrastructure. A project contains multiple *environments*, which are Git branches.

Every branch enables you to develop features, test, or fix bugs, just like you normally do in development. Not only that, every pull request to a branch is a separate staging system you can view in a browser and test using command-line or other automated test tools.

You can test every feature in isolation and put it into production with a 
single click, or a single command on the command-line.

The following figure shows how it works at a high level.

You get Magento code from our repository, create a [_project_]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/project/projects.html) which is based in Git, then do your customization in an [integration system]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/discover-arch.html#cloud-arch-int). You can use the Magento Cloud command line to configure your project and use an [automated deployment process]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/discover-deploy.html) to push code from integration to [staging]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/discover-arch.html#cloud-arch-stage) and finally to [production]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/iscover-arch.html#cloud-arch-prod).

### Use any methodology
You can use any methodology you already have or you can invent new ones. For example, you can use a Development -> Staging -> Production workflow.

As another example, if you are using an agile methodology such as scrum you can create [branches for every sprint]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/env/environments.html#cloud-env-work).

From each sprint, you can have branches for every user story. All the stories
become testable. You can continually merge to the sprint branch and validate
that on a continuous basis. When the sprint ends, there is no testing
bottleneck, and you can just merge to master and put the whole sprint into
production.
