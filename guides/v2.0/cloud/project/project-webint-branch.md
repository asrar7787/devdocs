A Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition *environment* is a Git *branch* and you can manage your environments using either the Web Interface, the Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition CLI, or Git commands.

For more information about managing environments using the CLI, see [Get started with an environment]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/env/environments-start.html).

This topic discusses how to use the Web Interface to:

*	Add or delete an environment
*	Sync (`git pull`) from the environment's parent
*	Merge (`git push`) to the environment's parent

## Add or delete an environment {#project-branch-add}
This section discusses adding or deleting an environment (that is, a Git branch). You'll do your development in a branch and, when complete, merge (`git push`) the branch with its parent. Choose a parent branch that is related to the work you're going to do; for example, at the start of a sprint for developing Feature X, you'll probably choose the FeatureX branch as the parent.

Deleting a branch by default makes the branch *inactive*. An inactive branch doesn't count against your total of eight possible project branches. You can either activate the branch later or you can [delete it entirely]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/howtos/environment-tutorial-env-merge.html#tut-env-delete) using the CLI.

{% collapsible Click to add an environment %}

To add an environment:

1.	[Log in to your project]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/project/project-webint-basic.html#project-login).
2.	In the left navigation bar, click the name of the parent environment.

	Your new branch is cloned from this environment. Choose a parent environment that is similar to the environment you're about to create.
3.	Click ![Create a branch]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_branch-icon.png){:width="30px"}.
4.	In the provided field, enter a branch name. In many cases, the environment name is the same as its ID.

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
   		<p>The environment <em>name</em> is different from the environment <em>ID</em> only if you use spaces or capital letters in the environment name. An environment ID consists of all lowercase letters, numbers, and allowed symbols. Capital letters in an environment name are converted to lowercase in the ID; spaces in an environment name are converted to dashes.</p>
   		<p>An environment name <em>cannot</em> include characters reserved for your Linux shell or for regular expressions. Forbidden characters include curly braces (<code>{ }</code>), parentheses, asterisk (<code>*</code>), angle brackets (<code>&lt; ></code>), ampersand (<code>&</code>), percent (<code>%</code>), and other characters.</p>
 	</div>
5.	Click **Branch**.
6.	Wait while the environment deploys.

	During deployment, its status is **In process**, as the following figure shows.

	![Branch is deploying]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_branch-deploy.png)

	After a successful deployment, the status changes to **Success**:

	![Branch is deploying]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_branch-success.png)
7.	Continue with one of the following:

	*	[Get started with an environment]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/env/environments-start.html)
	*	[How tos and tutorials]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/howtos/how-to.html)

{% endcollapsible %}

{% collapsible Click to delete an environment %}

To delete an environment and make it inactive:

1.	[Log in to your project]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/project/project-webint-basic.html#project-login).
2.	In the left pane, click the name of the branch to delete.
3.	Click **Configure environment** as the following figure shows.

	![Configure environment]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_project-env.png)
4.	Click the **Settings** tab.
5.	Click **Delete** next to the environment's status, as the following figure shows.

	![Delete an environment]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_env-delete.png)

	A deleted (that is, inactive) environment displays with its name stricken out as the following figure shows.

	![Delete an environment]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_environment-deleted.png)

{% endcollapsible %}
	
## Sync from the environment's parent {#project-branch-sync}
Syncing an environment is the same as `git pull origin <parent>`. You sync to get updated code from a parent environment (that is, a Git branch).

{% collapsible Click to show/hide content %}

To sync an environment with its parent:

1.	[Log in to your project]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/project/project-webint-basic.html#project-login).
2.	In the left pane, click the name of the branch you want to sync.
3.	Click ![Sync an environment]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_environment-sync.png){:width="30px"} (sync).

	The following prompt displays:

	![Choose what to sync]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_environment-sync2.png)
4.	Select the check box next to each item to sync and click **Sync**.

{% endcollapsible %}

## Merge with the environment's parent {#project-branch-merge}
Merging an environment is the same as `git push origin`. You merge to push updated code from an environment to its parent environment (that is, a Git branch).

{% collapsible Click to show/hide content %}

To merge an environment with its parent:

1.	[Log in to your project]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/project/project-webint-basic.html#project-login).
2.	In the left pane, click the name of the branch you want to merge.
3.	Click ![Merge an environment]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_environment-merge.png){:width="30px"} (merge).
4.	Click **Merge** to confirm the action.
