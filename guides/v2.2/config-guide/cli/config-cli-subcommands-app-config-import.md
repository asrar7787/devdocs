This topic discusses a command you can use to import configuration information for websites, stores, store views, and their associated themes. The configuration is stored in the shared configuration, `config.php`.

After importing, you can create product attributes and apply them to websites, stores, and store views. 

If the database and `config.php` are not in synchronization, errors display in the {% glossarytooltip 18b930cf-09cc-47c9-a5e5-905f86c43f81 %}Magento Admin{% endglossarytooltip %} with suggested corrective actions.

For more information about this process, see TBD.
