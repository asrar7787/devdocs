## Account owner overview {#cloud-owner-over}
After your company licenses the Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition, the only person who has access to it is the *account owner*&mdash;the person who purchased the software. The account owner is typically a "business user"&mdash; someone in the business or finance organization. 

This topic discusses initial tasks the account owner should perform to give technical people access to the project.

Before you start, you must know the e-mail address for each user you'd like to add. After you add these users to the project, they receive an invitation to register with Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition.

## Sign up for an account {#cloud-first-acct}
To sign up for a Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition account, contact [Magento Sales](https://magento.com/explore/contact-sales){:target="_blank"}. They will create your account and send you a welcome e-mail that provides instructions to access the project.

The person who signs up for a Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition account is referred to as the *account owner*. You receive a welcome e-mail that enables you to set up the project initially.

## Your welcome e-mail {#cloud-first-email}
After you register for an account, Magento sends you a welcome e-mail at the address at which you registered. The e-mail contains a link to your Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition project.

You can also access your project by logging in to your Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition account.

## Generate authentication keys {#cloud-owner-keys}
Getting the Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition requires authentication keys. Only the account owner can create these keys.

As the account owner, you must create one set of keys for each technical person you expect will work on Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition. Each user must add these keys to their `auth.json` file, which is located in the project root directory.

We recommend against providing the keys over e-mail because it isn't secure; instead, use a company intranet portal or wiki.

{% include cloud/auth-json.md %}

## Create project administrators {#cloud-owner-admins}
As discussed in more detail in [Manage users]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/project/user-admin.html), Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition has a number of user roles.

Typically, the only user the account owner must create is the *project administrator* (also referred to as the super user). This user can create other users and delegate roles as desired.

{% collapsible To create project administrators: %}

1.  Log in to [your Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition account](https://accounts.magento.cloud){:target="_blank"}.
2.  Click the **Projects** tab as the following figure shows.

	![Click the projects tab to access your Cloud project]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_account_project.png){:width="550px"}
3.	Click the name of your project (typically, **Untitled Project**).

	The Setting up your project page displays as follows.

	![Cancel project creation]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_project_continue-later.png){:width="500px"}

3.  Click **Continue later**. (Someone else can create the project at a later time.)
4.	Click the configure project button next to **Project Title** in the top navigation bar as the following figure shows.

	![]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_project-add-superuser.png){:width="500px"}
7.	Enter the following information:

	*	In the first field, enter the user's e-mail address.
	*	Select the **Super User** check box.
8.	Click **Add User**.

The super users you add receive an e-mail inviting them to join the Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition project. The user must follow the prompts to register an account and verify their e-mail address.

Initially, a super user must create the project in any of the following ways:

*	[Create a sample Magento project from a template]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/access-acct/first-time-setup_template.html)
*	[Import an existing Magento project]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/access-acct/first-time-setup_import-first-steps.html)

## Blackfire and New Relic credentials {#cloud-owner-creds}
Your project includes Blackfire and New Relic credentials. Only you&mdash;the account owner&mdash;can access them. You should provide these credentials to technical people as needed.

### Blackfire credentials 
To get your Blackfire credentials:
