[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/why-fastly){:target="_blank"} is required for Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition. It works with Varnish to provide fast caching capabilities and a {% glossarytooltip f83f1fa7-7a64-467b-b629-c2d0c25d2e7f %}Content Delivery Network{% endglossarytooltip %} (CDN) for static assets.

## Get your Fastly credentials {#cloud-fastly-creds}
To get Fastly credentials, open a [support ticket]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/welcome/get-help.html). You must provide your fully-qualified {% glossarytooltip 41aee03b-a5d5-49c2-8839-894090ef4e86 %}domain{% endglossarytooltip %} name.

We'll provide you with the following information so you can enable Fastly:

*	Fastly {% glossarytooltip 786086f2-622b-4007-97fe-2c19e5283035 %}API{% endglossarytooltip %} key
*	Fastly service ID

## Get started {#cloud-fastly-start}
Fastly recommends you do your development in its own branch because fine-tuning Fastly can be a complex process, depending on your needs and eCommerce shop size.

In the procedure that follows, make sure you *branch* a new environment; don't use an existing one unless you know this is what you want to do.

{% collapsible To get started: %}

{% include cloud/cli-get-started.md %}

{% endcollapsible %}

## Install Fastly in your new environment {#cloud-fastly-setup}
1.	In your local environment root directory, enter the following commands in the order shown:

		composer config repositories.fastly-magento2 git "https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2.git"
		composer require fastly/magento2

2.	Wait for dependencies to be updated.
3.	Enter the following command:

		php bin/magento setup:upgrade && php bin/magento cache:clean
3.	Add, commit, and push the change:

		git add -A; git commit -m "Install Fastly"; git push origin <branch name>

## Enable Fastly using the Magento Admin {#cloud-fastly-admin}
1.	Log in to your local {% glossarytooltip 18b930cf-09cc-47c9-a5e5-905f86c43f81 %}Magento Admin{% endglossarytooltip %} as an administrator. 

	If you don't remember your login information, enter the following command:

		magento-cloud var:list
2.	Click **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System**.
3.	In the right pane, expand **Full Page Cache**. 

	The page is displayed as follows.

	![Choose Fastly]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_fastly_menu.png){:width="650px"}
4.	Next to the **Caching Application** list, clear the **Use system value** check box.
5.	From the **Caching Application** list, click **Fastly CDN** as the following figure shows.

	![Choose Fastly]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud-fastly_enable-admin.png){:width="550px"}

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info" markdown="1">
*	Ignore the link to create a free Fastly account; we'll provide your Fastly credentials.
*	With Fastly version 1.2.0 and later, you no longer need to upload your VCL to Fastly. The **Upload VCL to Fastly** button enables you to upload [VCL snippets](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/vcl-snippets/about-vcl-snippets){:target="_blank"}, which is an advanced option you can consider in a staging or production system.
</div>

<!-- After you receive a Magento VCL from Fastly, [upload it to your staging or production system]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/live/stage-prod-migrate-prereq.html#cloud-live-migrate-fastly).
 -->

## Configure Fastly {#cloud-fastly-config}
Configure Fastly using the following:

*	We provide your Fastly service ID and API key.
*	Set most other Fastly configuration options in the Magento {% glossarytooltip 29ddb393-ca22-4df9-a8d4-0024d75739b1 %}Admin{% endglossarytooltip %}.
*	You can fine-tune the Fastly configuration as discussed in [Custom VCLs](#custom-vcl).

To configure Fastly in the Admin:

1.	Log in to the Magento Admin as an administrator.
2.	Click **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System**.
3.	In the right pane, expand **Full Page Cache**. 
4.	Expand **Fastly Configuration**.

	You can then [choose caching options](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/CONFIGURATION.md#configure-the-module){:target="_blank"}.
5.	When you're done, click **Save Config** at the top of the page.

For details about Fastly configuration, see the [Fastly documentation](https://docs.fastly.com/guides){:target="_blank"}.

### Create a custom error/maintenance page {#fastly-errpg}
You can optionally create a custom {% glossarytooltip a2aff425-07dd-4bd6-9671-29b7edefa871 %}HTML{% endglossarytooltip %} page for errors or when your site is down for maintenance. This page can give confidence to your customers; instead of seeing HTTP error codes, they'll see a page that explains that your site is down temporarily.

To create a custom error/maintenance page:

1.	In the Admin, in the Fastly Configuration section, expand **Error/Maintenance Page** as the following figure shows.

	![Custom Fastly error page]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud-fastly_err-pg.png){:width="650px"}
2.	Click **Set HTML**.
3.	In the provided field, enter your HTML.

	The HTML you enter can be a maximum of 65,535 bytes in length.

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info" markdown="1">
	Avoid using images on your site in the event Fastly is not available. To use images, refer to [Data URIs on the css-tricks site](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/){:target="_blank"}.
	</div>
4.	When you're done, click **Upload**.
5.	In the Magento Admin, click **Save Config**.

### Upload any Fastly VCL snippets {#cloud-live-migrate-fastly-snip}
A [Fastly VCL snippet](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/vcl-snippets/about-vcl-snippets){:target="_blank"} is an advanced option that enables you to modify Fastly behavior with service-oriented or versionless objects.

To use snippets, you must upload the Fastly VCL using the Magento Admin as follows:

1.	Log in to the Magento Admin as an administrator. 
2.	Click **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System** as the following figure shows:

	![Choose Fastly]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_fastly_menu.png){:width="650px"}
3.	In the right pane, expand **Full Page Cache**. 
4.	Click **Upload VCL to Fastly** as the following figure shows.

	![Upload a Magento VCL to Fastly]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_upload-vcl-to-fastly.png)

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info" markdown="1">
  		If the **Upload VCL to Fastly** button does not display, you should upgrade the Fastly extension to version 1.2.0 or later. For details, see [Update extensions]({{ page.baseurl}}cloud/howtos/update-components.html). Fastly's Composer name is `fastly/magento2`.
	</div>

5.	Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the task.

### Advanced configuration options
For advanced configuration options, customize the [Fastly configuration](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/etc/fastly.vcl){:target="_blank"}.

For more information, see [Fastly documentation](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/vcl/guide-to-vcl){:target="_blank"}.

## Merge your Fastly branch {#cloud-fastly-merge}
When you're done with development, [merge your environment]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/howtos/environment-tutorial-env-merge.html) with its parent environment.

For Fastly to be used in production, you must merge with the `master` environment.

## Custom VCLs {#custom-vcl}
You're free to customize your Fastly VCL however you want, provided you follow Fastly's guidelines for <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/guides/vcl/mixing-and-matching-fastly-vcl-with-custom-vcl" target="_blank">Mixing and matching Fastly VCL with custom VCL</a>.

Failure to follow these guidelines means your customizations won't work as expected.
