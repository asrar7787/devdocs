This topic shows how to get started working on a project.

## Command summary {#cloud-proj-start-summ}
The following commands can be run from any directory. However, it's simpler to run them from a project directory. If so, you can omit the `-p <project ID>` parameter.

All commands are shown with required options only. Get help for any `magento-cloud` command by appending `--help`.

`git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy" && git push <branch name>`
:  Push an empty commit to force a redeployment. Some actions, like adding a user for example, don't result in deployment.

`magento-cloud login`
:	Log in to the project

`magento-cloud project:list`
:	List project IDs

`magento-cloud environment:list -p <project ID>`
:	List the environments in the current project (that is, the project that corresponds to the directory in which you run the command).

`magento-cloud project:get <project ID> <directory> -e <environment ID>`
:	Clone a project to a directory. To clone the `master` environment, omit `-e <environment ID>`.

:	List information about the project, including ID, name, region, URL, and Git {% glossarytooltip a05c59d3-77b9-47d0-92a1-2cbffe3f8622 %}URL{% endglossarytooltip %}.
