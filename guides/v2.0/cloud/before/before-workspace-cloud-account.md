Before you can access your Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition project, you must [create an account](https://accounts.magento.cloud){:target="_blank"}. 

Usually, you'll receive an e-mail invitation to set up an account to use the project. If you don't see the invitation, check your junk e-mail folder.
