This topic discusses tasks we strongly recommend you perform before pushing code from an [integration system]({{ page.baseurl}}cloud/reference/discover-arch.html#cloud-arch-int) to either [staging]({{ page.baseurl}}cloud/reference/discover-arch.html#cloud-arch-stage}}) or [production]({{ page.baseurl}}cloud/reference/discover-arch.html#cloud-arch-prod}}). Failure to perform these tasks can result in additional debugging and delays in testing your site.

As discussed in [Deployment process]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/discover-deploy.html), building and deployment is a five-phase process. This topic discusses how to simulate build and deploy steps locally, which can expose issues early in your development process when they're easier to debug and fix.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" markdown="1">
Do your testing in an integration or staging environment _only_. Do not do any testing in production; the production environment is your live site; it shouldn't be used for testing.

Your staging environment is better for testing because it has Fastly, New Relic, and so on. Your integration environment typically does not have Fastly or New Relic.
</div>

## Step 1: Push code to the Cloud server
Before you continue, make sure you push all current code to the remote Cloud server so that, in {% glossarytooltip c57aef7c-97b4-4b2b-a999-8001accef1fe %}event{% endglossarytooltip %} of issues, you can recover the state of the Magento application.

### Get started

{% collapsible To get started: %}

{% include cloud/cli-get-started.md %}

{% endcollapsible %}

### Push code to the remote server

{% collapsible To push code to your remote server: %}

1.	If you haven't already done so, change to your project root directory.
2.	Enter the following commands:

		git add -A && git commit -m "<comment>"
		git push origin <branch name>
3.	Wait for deployment to complete.

{% endcollapsible %}

## Step 2: Build phase
During the [build phase]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/discover-deploy.html#cloud-deploy-over-phases-build), we perform the following tasks:

*	Apply patches distributed to all Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition customers
*	Apply patches we provided specifically to you
*	Enable all modules
*	Compile code and the {% glossarytooltip 2be50595-c5c7-4b9d-911c-3bf2cd3f7beb %}dependency injection{% endglossarytooltip %} configuration

Before you continue, you must know the file system path to any patch we provided specifically to you. Typically, hot fixes are in the `<Magento root dir>/m2-hotfixes` directory.

{% collapsible To build your site: %}

1.	Apply patches distributed to all Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition customers.

	Enter the following command from the project root directory:

		php vendor/magento/magento-cloud-configuration/patch.php

	Output includes the following:

		[2016-11-30 15:05:15] Copying static.php to front-static.php
		[2016-11-30 15:05:15] Command:git apply /var/www/html/magento2/vendor/magento/magento-cloud-configuration/patches/000-MAGETWO-57719-2.1.2.patch
		[2016-11-30 15:05:15] Status:0
		[2016-11-30 15:05:15] Output:array (
		)
		[2016-11-30 15:05:15] Command:git apply /var/www/html/magento2/vendor/magento/magento-cloud-configuration/patches/MAGETWO-52660-scd-improvement.patch
		[2016-11-30 15:05:15] Status:0
		[2016-11-30 15:05:15] Output:array (
		)

		... more ...
							)
3.	Apply hot fixes and other patches provided to you:

		git apply <path to patch>

	For example, to apply hot fixes:

		git apply m2-hotfixes/<patch file name>

	If the `m2-hotfixes` directory is empty, skip this step.

	If patches are present, output from this command is similar to the preceding command.
4.	Enable all modules:

		php bin/magento module:enable --all

5.	Compile code and the dependency injection configuration:

		php bin/magento  setup:di:compile

	This command can take several minutes to complete.

	Messages similar to the following are displayed:

		Compilation was started.

If errors display, debug them if possible or open a [support ticket]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/welcome/get-help.html) to get additional assistance.

We strongly recommend you do all your testing in an integration or staging environment only, and _not_ in production.

{% endcollapsible %}

## Step 3: Deploy phase
During the [deployment phase]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/discover-deploy.html#cloud-deploy-over-phases-hook), we perform the following tasks:

*	Installs the Magento application if it isn't already
*	If the Magento application is installed, upgrades components
*	Clears the {% glossarytooltip 0bc9c8bc-de1a-4a06-9c99-a89a29c30645 %}cache{% endglossarytooltip %}
*	Sets the Magento application for [`production`]({{ page.baseurl}}config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#mode-production) mode

{% collapsible To deploy your site: %}

1.	If you haven't done so already, log in as or switch to the [Magento file system owner]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/before/before-workspace-file-sys-owner.html).
2.	Change to your project root directory.
3.	Enter the following command:

		php bin/magento setup:upgrade

	(If you haven't installed the Magento application yet, use the [`magento setup:install`]({{ page.baseurl }}install-gde/install/cli/install-cli.html) command instead.)
4.	Clean the Magento cache:

		php bin/magento cache:clean
5.	Set the Magento application for [production mode]({{ page.baseurl }}config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#mode-production):

		php bin/magento deploy:mode:set production

If errors display, debug them if possible or open a [support ticket]() to get additional assistance.

We strongly recommend you do all your testing in an integration or staging environment only, and _not_ in production.
